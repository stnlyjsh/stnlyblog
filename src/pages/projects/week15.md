# Week 12

summary here
Learned Pandas this week and how to convert files into dataframes, then pull just the 'series' I want from those so I no longer have to manually enter the weekly schedule in a block of text. I do have to change the week # manually still, I'm sure I could get around this by having it check for date & then do like distance from start date to current date % 7 + 1 = current week or something. I'll look into that. I also want to move & rename the files from my downloads to the project directory instead of manually renaming & dropping, shouldn't be too crazy.

<picks>

<pick>
<confidence_points>16</confidence_points>
<winner>Dallas Cowboys</winner>
<loser>Carolina Panthers</loser>
<reasoning>
The Cowboys (5-8) face the Panthers (3-10) in a clear mismatch. Despite some injuries, Dallas has a strong offensive unit and the Panthers have struggled significantly, scoring only 233 points this season (lowest in the league). The Panthers' defense has allowed 382 points, making this a favorable matchup for Dallas.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>15</confidence_points>
<winner>San Francisco 49ers</winner>
<loser>Los Angeles Rams</loser>
<reasoning>
The 49ers have been dominant at home and have a strong defense. While the Rams (7-6) have shown improvement, they're facing a tough matchup. The key injury to Trent Williams could impact the 49ers, but their overall team strength and home field advantage make them a confident pick.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>14</confidence_points>
<winner>Buffalo Bills</winner>
<loser>Detroit Lions</loser>
<reasoning>
The Bills (10-3) have been playing excellent football lately and have a more consistent defense than Detroit. While the Lions (12-1) have impressed this season, Buffalo's defensive prowess and offensive capabilities make them a strong pick, especially with Josh Allen playing well.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>13</confidence_points>
<winner>Kansas City Chiefs</winner>
<loser>Cleveland Browns</loser>
<reasoning>
Despite their offensive struggles, the Chiefs (12-1) remain a formidable team. Cleveland (3-10) has significant quarterback issues and injuries, including Deshaun Watson out for the season. Patrick Mahomes typically performs well in December games.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>12</confidence_points>
<winner>Miami Dolphins</winner>
<loser>Houston Texans</loser>
<reasoning>
The Dolphins (6-7) have a dynamic offense and matchup well against Houston. While the Texans (8-5) have exceeded expectations, Miami's speed and offensive capabilities should be too much to handle, especially with several key Texans dealing with injuries.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>11</confidence_points>
<winner>Baltimore Ravens</winner>
<loser>New York Giants</loser>
<reasoning>
The Ravens (8-5) have a strong defense and face a Giants team (2-11) that has struggled mightily this season. Baltimore's balanced attack and defensive strength make them a solid pick against a depleted Giants roster.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>10</confidence_points>
<winner>New Orleans Saints</winner>
<loser>Washington Commanders</loser>
<reasoning>
The Saints (5-8) at home have an advantage against a Commanders team (8-5) that has been inconsistent. New Orleans' defense should contain Washington's offense, and the home field advantage will be significant.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>9</confidence_points>
<winner>Jacksonville Jaguars</winner>
<loser>New York Jets</loser>
<reasoning>
Despite recent struggles, the Jaguars (3-10) have more offensive weapons than the Jets (3-10). The Jets' offensive limitations and quarterback issues make Jacksonville the favorite at home.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>8</confidence_points>
<winner>Los Angeles Chargers</winner>
<loser>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</loser>
<reasoning>
The Chargers (8-5) have better offensive weapons, though injuries are a concern. The Buccaneers (7-6) have been inconsistent, and traveling to the West Coast often presents challenges.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>7</confidence_points>
<winner>Seattle Seahawks</winner>
<loser>Green Bay Packers</loser>
<reasoning>
Seattle (8-5) typically plays well at home, and while Green Bay (9-4) has improved, the Seahawks' home field advantage and defensive capabilities give them an edge in this matchup.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>6</confidence_points>
<winner>Tennessee Titans</winner>
<loser>Cincinnati Bengals</loser>
<reasoning>
The Titans (3-10) at home face a Bengals team (5-8) dealing with significant injuries. While neither team has impressed, Tennessee's home field advantage could be the difference.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>5</confidence_points>
<winner>Denver Broncos</winner>
<loser>Indianapolis Colts</loser>
<reasoning>
Denver (8-5) has shown improvement and plays well at home. The Colts (6-7) have been inconsistent, and the altitude factor at Mile High Stadium could impact their performance.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>4</confidence_points>
<winner>Philadelphia Eagles</winner>
<loser>Pittsburgh Steelers</loser>
<reasoning>
The Eagles (11-2) have superior talent but have shown vulnerability. The Steelers (10-3) are tough defensively, making this a closer matchup than records might suggest.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>3</confidence_points>
<winner>Las Vegas Raiders</winner>
<loser>Atlanta Falcons</loser>
<reasoning>
The Raiders (2-11) have struggled but play better at home. The Falcons (6-7) have been inconsistent on the road, making this a potential upset opportunity.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>2</confidence_points>
<winner>Arizona Cardinals</winner>
<loser>New England Patriots</loser>
<reasoning>
Both teams have struggled, but the Cardinals (6-7) at home have shown more offensive capability than the Patriots (3-10), who have major offensive issues.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<final_matchup>
<confidence_points>1</confidence_points>
<winner>Minnesota Vikings</winner>
<loser>Chicago Bears</loser>
<total_score>41</total_score>
<reasoning>
This NFC North rivalry game is difficult to predict. The Vikings (11-2) have been more successful but face uncertainty at quarterback. The Bears (4-9) have shown improvement but remain inconsistent. Expect a relatively high-scoring game due to both teams' defensive vulnerabilities, with Minnesota's overall team strength ultimately prevailing. Predicted final score: Vikings 24, Bears 17.
