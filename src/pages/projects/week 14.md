# Week 14

This week I tried to make some modification to the request file & piped in player stats along with all the previous information. Unfortunately doing this put me over the request token limit, so it had to be removed. Pretty disappointing that even with the api I'm hitting limits I don't really get why I can't just pay another dollar to make it think for 10 more seconds but maybe there is an exponential cost to this I'm not considering.

Either way, I reached out to Near on twitter for advice on getting around this if it's even possible.

Still need to learn Pandas so that it can pull out just the matchup data for the week I want as I still have to do that manually and claude really struggles with this.

Claude's response: Message(id='msg_01DDRbsebims4aanq4LTuSja', content=[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze the matchups and generate picks based on the provided data. Here are my confidence-ranked selections:

<picks>
<pick>
<confidence_points>16</confidence_points>
<winner>San Francisco 49ers</winner>
<loser>Chicago Bears</loser>
<reasoning>
The 49ers are one of the most complete teams in the NFL, with a strong defense and versatile offense. While Chicago has shown improvement, they're still struggling for consistency. The 49ers' home-field advantage and superior talent across the board make this a high-confidence pick.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>15</confidence_points>
<winner>Miami Dolphins</winner>
<loser>New York Jets</loser>
<reasoning>
The Dolphins have been dominant at home, and the Jets continue to struggle offensively. With multiple Jets players including Sauce Gardner questionable with injuries, Miami's high-powered offense should have a strong showing.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>14</confidence_points>
<winner>Kansas City Chiefs</winner>
<loser>Los Angeles Chargers</loser>
<reasoning>
The Chiefs have dominated this division rivalry historically, and the Chargers are dealing with multiple key injuries. Kansas City's defense has been excellent, and they typically perform well at home.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>13</confidence_points>
<winner>Philadelphia Eagles</winner>
<loser>Carolina Panthers</loser>
<reasoning>
Despite some recent struggles, the Eagles remain one of the NFL's top teams. The Panthers have the league's worst record and are dealing with multiple injuries. Philadelphia should bounce back strongly at home.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>12</confidence_points>
<winner>Detroit Lions</winner>
<loser>Green Bay Packers</loser>
<reasoning>
The Lions have been excellent at home and their offense matches up well against Green Bay's defense. With Jaire Alexander out for the Packers, Detroit's passing attack should thrive.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>11</confidence_points>
<winner>Buffalo Bills</winner>
<loser>Los Angeles Rams</loser>
<reasoning>
The Bills have shown signs of returning to form, and while the Rams have exceeded expectations, Buffalo's talent advantage and desperation for wins should push them through.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>10</confidence_points>
<winner>Seattle Seahawks</winner>
<loser>Arizona Cardinals</loser>
<reasoning>
Seattle needs this win to stay in playoff contention. Despite some injuries, they match up well against a Cardinals team that has overachieved but remains limited talent-wise.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>9</confidence_points>
<winner>Jacksonville Jaguars</winner>
<loser>Tennessee Titans</loser>
<reasoning>
The Jaguars are fighting for their division lead and have more talent across the board. The Titans are struggling offensively and dealing with multiple injuries.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>8</confidence_points>
<winner>Minnesota Vikings</winner>
<loser>Atlanta Falcons</loser>
<reasoning>
The Vikings have shown resilience despite QB changes, and their defense has been playing well. The Falcons have been inconsistent and struggle on the road.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>7</confidence_points>
<winner>Cleveland Browns</winner>
<loser>Pittsburgh Steelers</loser>
<reasoning>
The Browns' defense has been exceptional, and despite offensive struggles, they match up well against a Steelers team that's having significant offensive issues of their own.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>6</confidence_points>
<winner>New Orleans Saints</winner>
<loser>New York Giants</loser>
<reasoning>
The Saints have been inconsistent but face a Giants team that's struggled mightily on offense. New Orleans' defense should control this game.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<pick>
<confidence_points>5</confidence_points>
<winner>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</winner>
<loser>Las Vegas Raiders</loser>
<reasoning>
The Buccaneers have shown fight in recent weeks while the Raiders continue to struggle, especially on the road. Home field advantage could be decisive.
</reasoning>
</pick>

<final_matchup>
<confidence_points>1</confidence_points>
<winner>Dallas Cowboys</winner>
<loser>Cincinnati Bengals</loser>
<total_score>47</total_score>
<reasoning>
The Cowboys have been dominant at home, while the Bengals are adjusting to life without Joe Burrow. Dallas's offense has been explosive at AT&T Stadium, but Cincinnati's defense could keep this closer than expected. Expect a high-scoring affair with Dallas's home-field advantage being the difference.

**cost**
$1.15, but I did run the original claudefidence pool script first on accident which is much more costly as I pulled in some pretty inefficient data from a deprecated api. I'd guess just the prompt above was about ~45 cents
