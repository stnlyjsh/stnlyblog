<p> I'm enjoying Toronto and I'm happy to have the time away. Honestly it's just like USA if we allowed the french to taint us. It really does make me appreciate the US in a lot of ways. The trashcans here are comically small. There's a wonderful cafe just up the street with the flakiest bread and really good espresso for like $3 CAD. I miss my friends already. I'm spending too much time redoing this again. But I wanted to learn to code so that I could express myself and this is it, so maybe it's fine. I need to circle back to recursion soon. I'd like to be kinder to myself. I love you. </p>
