<p>If you didn't know I'm learning to program. Mostly because I have a desire to create something and most of my ideas require some level of coding. I've tried in the past and failed, but this time around I've found a more engaing format which works better for me. I originally found it when learning SQL but hadn't seen it replicated anywhere until recently when I found another site that focuses on backend languages in the same format. Check my progress directly <a href="https://www.boot.dev/u/slowbro">here</a> or check my PR's for summaries and insight.

This has been on the backburner a little bit because I wanted to create a site to serve as a form of asynchronous communication between my friends and I. Although after all of their dismay at me leaving/ghosting I think only langston actually checked it lol. I whipped up the first rendition by renting a small linode server, using ploi's free tier to install wordpress, & transferring my domain from squarespace (formerly google) to porkbun. TLDR; squarespace dns sucks ass and you shouldn't buy a .dev domain if you don't known what you're doing.

Then I decided to be a hipster and nuke that site, ditching wordpress/ploi & linode in favor of astro & netlify. I did this because I liked the return to 90's neo-tech aesthetic of sites like <a href="https://lelouch.dev/">lelouch.dev</a> or the actual 90's aesthetic of this french autist's (incredible) <a href="https://bellard.org/"> life's work</a>. 

I've come to see the value wordpress' ease of use provides. After 5(?) days I've gained a vague understanding of html/js/css and the majority of the skeleton of this site but I've lost most of what I learned in the current section of the backend course and 5 days of studying. I could've achieved the same thing with <a href="https://bearblog.dev">this cutie</a> in much less time. BUT in like 6 months when I learn JS and front end maybe I can actually make this site cool and will have a foundation already laid. And I inflated my github activity :].

Anyways all that to say I've been learning python, hope to be learning GO & JS soon, got sidetracked into webdev for a bit and would love to return one day. In the backend course I'm in what is heralded as by far the hardest section of the path & probably need to restart this course entirely because I was already struggling with it before pivoting to webdev. 

Hopefully by the end of all this I can make things I'm proud of.
